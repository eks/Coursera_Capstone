Specifically, this report an provide a reference for new parents who are interested in moving to a neighborhood in Toronto that has a good infrastructure that helps with the rising and development of a child.\n\nToronto is the capital of Ontario, the largest city in Canada, and the city that attracts the most visitors in the entire country. What make Toronto the best city in Canada it's the diverse neighborhoods located throughout the city, each a micro cultural hub with unique restaurants, shops, and parks.\n\nIn this report, we will focus on all areas on Toronto. Among all the neighborhoods in Torontos, we will analyze data, build indicators and finally identify the best neighborhoods to raise a child. Then, we will use the clustering model to find similar areas in the city, considering the demographic data of each neighborhood and region. The preferred area should contain as many facilities as possible.\n\nWe will use data science tools to fetch the raw data, visualize it then generate a few most promising areas based on above criteria. We will use the techniques and tools learned throughout the course to capture, clean, format and build indicators and visualize data in order to classify the city's neighborhoods. During the process we will explain the findings, identify advantages and disadvantages so that new parents can choose a neighborhood to raise their children based on data."
